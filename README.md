# SeektheTreasure
Seek the Treasure is a dungeon maze game built using PyGame.

# Playing the Game
Unfortunately, the executable file is too large to be uploaded into the repository. There are two ways you can play the game:
1) Download the zipped folder with all the files from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sjz_eoiAJEwZgLjx_IzQL1NiTBBeGE_e/view?usp=sharing) and open the exe file to play
2) You can download this repository and follow the instructions from this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTxaran0Cig&ab_channel=DaFluffyPotato) to create an executable file on your own computer

# Game Play
The game play is fairly simple where you control a player who can move in a maze. The objective is to reach the treasure chest while avoiding the fire sprites. You have three lives that get reset each level and the option to restart that level if you die. The 'intelligence' of the fire sprites increases from Level 2 to Level 3 where instead of moving on a fixed path, they can detect you and 'chase' after you.

# Future of the Game
I made this game as part of Creatica Hackathon 2020. There are a few major modifications I would make to the game if I had more time:
- Include a narrative storyline
- Every level would be a minigame that served to further the plot
- Fix the main character so she doesn't continuously bounce of the walls
- Increase the 'intelligence' of the fire sprites
- Create a maze generator

# Code Replication
I encourage you to build on the code I have begun! The beauty of games is that there are an infinite number of modifications and improvements that can be made. No game will ever be 'complete' in that sense. I have attributed some of the most useful resources for coding PyGame in the python files themselves, so do check those out if you are interested in pursuing a similar project. I have also included all the links to the assets I've used, except for the main character and backgrounds because I made those myself, so if you do plan on using them do attribute me.

The limitation of PyGame is that it is not easily mounted onto a web application which makes it difficult to share with others. I would suggest also checking out Unity (another game making software) or Twine (choose-your-adventure game maker). I have not tried either of these software yet, but I have been recommended them as an avenue for making games. I used PyGame because I am proficient in Python so it was convenient to code, but I do regret the inaccessibility of the final format.
